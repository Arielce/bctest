# bctest
This's an android app for learning purpose.
It's for EOS test.
Welcome anybody to clone or contribute to it.
You can just copy it for your develop and test purpose.
The only thing need to pay attention:
In this project, I used many code from EosCommander(https://github.com/plactal/EosCommander), including wallet and transaction related.
you need to comply with EosCommander 's requirements of using the code.
Thanks EosCommander!

If you wish to use it in your product, you need to copy below folders:
bctest\app\src\main\java\io  (this's from EosCommander)
bctest\app\src\main\java\com\maods\bctest\EOS
and the files under bctest\app\src\main\java\com\maods\bctest (not too much ,just for common utilities)
